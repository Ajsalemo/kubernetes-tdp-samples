# kubernetes-tdp-samples

This repository contains three ways to run containers on Kubernetes

```md
├── aks
    // This contains a deployable example to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
├── docker-desktop
    // This contains a deployable example to Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled
├── minikube 
    // This contains a deployable example to Minikube
```

All three examples container some documentation on how to set up the environment prior to deployment.
